## Java Practice from the Java Masterclass 2025 course on Udemy

This contains my solutions for some of the exercises and challenges in the course, with 
each problem in its own file/package, and sorted by section. 
Not every exercise/challenge is here - some of them I just completed in the udemy web editor.

There are a lot of projects here and most of them are quite small, and made exactly to the specifications of the exercise.
However, some others were bigger and more open ended, so if you want to look at anything, look at these ones.

**Projects Of Note:**

- **Section 8 - Restaurants:** a bigger challenge without step-by-step instructions so the 
implementation is all my own choices.

- **Section 11 - AbstractClassPractice:** a hefty exercise where we implemented our own linked 
list and binary search tree, complete with *add*, *remove*, and *traverse* methods.

- **Section 15 - CardGame:** we were tasked with making a little card game, making use of some of the methods in the collections class.
I got slightly carried away and made klondike solitaire :) The output may be a bit wonky because of the emojis. I used the font 'Courier New' which keeps everything aligned! It works! But in future I may add more features.
